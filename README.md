# spatial-frequency-preferences-notebooks

Notebooks from the development of the spatial frequency preferences project

During the development of the [spatial frequency
preferences](https://github.com/billbrod/spatial-frequency-preferences) project,
I created a variety of notebooks for exploring the data in a variety of ways.
Those didn't stay up-to-date and I think are generally more confusing than
anything else (for other people), but I wanted to hold on to them in case I want
to use them to try and understand how I was thinking about the project. So I've
moved them here.

They have the same python requirements as the original project (plus
[jupyter](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), obviously).
